    <h2>Project Summary & Infrastructure Design</h2>
    <p>This project simulates a medium-sized business environment using a Hyper-V virtualized infrastructure. The core objective was to gain hands-on expertise in essential on-premises Windows Server administration tasks, focusing on stability, security, and enterprise best practices.</p>

    <h3>Infrastructure Overview</h3>
    <p>The virtual environment utilizes Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 Enterprise clients, representing a modern enterprise setup.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Domain Controllers (DC01 & DC02): Deployed as redundant, high-availability Domain Controllers using Server Core for reduced attack surface and lower resource consumption.</li>
        <li>Server Core Configuration: IP addresses (10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2) and DNS settings were configured via PowerShell, including the proper setup of primary/secondary DNS servers (pointing to the peer DC and loopback) for replication integrity.</li>
        <li>Dedicated GUI Server (SRV01): Utilizes the Desktop Experience (10.0.0.3) to host necessary edge-case applications or provide a management point where a GUI is essential. SRV01 also hosts the centralized file share for user profiles and home directories.</li>
        <li>Client Base: Virtualized Windows 11 Enterprise clients for testing Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and user configurations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Core Project Goals & Accomplishments</h3>
    <p>The setup and configuration focused on replicating critical enterprise services and configurations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Active Directory (AD) Deployment: Successfully implemented a multi-DC, replicated AD forest (`joecorp.local`).</li>
        <li>Redundancy and Verification: Confirmed full AD replication between DC01 and DC02 using `repadmin /replsummary` and verified Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO) roles using `netdom query fsmo`.</li>
        <li>User Experience Management (New): Successfully implemented roaming profiles and configured home folders that are automatically mapped to a centralized file share hosted on SRV01, ensuring persistent user data across workstations.</li>
        <li>Security and Policy Segmentation (New): Created distinct Organizational Units (OUs) for different user groups, specifically:
            <ul>
                <li>Applied lockdown Group Policies (GPOs) to the `UsersOU` to restrict desktop and system access for standard users.</li>
                <li>Granted full administrative permissions on all workstations to accounts within the `IT OU`, demonstrating role-based access control.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes on Best Practices & Technical Execution</h3>
    <p>During deployment, several enterprise administration concepts were addressed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PowerShell Configuration: Utilized PowerShell commands like `New-NetIPAddress` and `Set-DnsClientServerAddress` for advanced IP configuration on Server Core, overcoming limitations of the basic `Sconfig` utility when a network gateway is absent.</li>
        <li>Staged DC Deployment: Demonstrated proficiency in deploying the initial AD forest using `Install-ADDSForest` and then correctly deploying a subsequent replica Domain Controller using `Install-ADDSDomainController`.</li>
    </ul>
