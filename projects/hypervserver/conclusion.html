                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strategic Pivoting and the Path of Least Resistance:</strong> The most significant
                        takeaway from this project was learning to identify when a technical path becomes a liability
                        rather than an asset. While an all-Windows stack (Hyper-V) appeared optimal on paper for hosting
                        Windows-based workloads, the administrative overhead caused by persistent CredSSP and WinRM
                        authentication issues in a workgroup environment created "friction" that outweighed the
                        benefits. By pivoting to Proxmox VE, I prioritized a robust, platform-agnostic management
                        interface over my initial familiarity with Windows tools. This decision not only resolved the
                        remote management bottlenecks but also broadened my competency in Linux administration and
                        open-source virtualization standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Troubleshooting and The Power of Documentation</strong> Beyond the initial
                        configuration, I found that the Proxmox documentation was an invaluable resource for resolving
                        issues. The community forums and documentation provided clear, step-by-step guides that helped
                        me
                        navigate complex configurations and resolve issues efficiently, such as my Nvidia-caused boot
                        failures or NUT permissions issues. This experience reinforced the
                        importance of thorough documentation and community support in technical projects. This helped me
                        realize that an IT professional's greatest asset is not knowing everything, but knowing how
                        to find, verify, and implement a solution.</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Technical Lessons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Systems Integration: </strong>Learning to bridge different systems, like my UPS
                        communicating with Linux, which then communicates to HomeKit, is the backbone of modern IT.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hardware Passthrough: </strong>While simple, my backup server disk passthrough is a
                        similar concept to passing through other hardware devices, like PCIe cards. Beyond that, my
                        passed through disks allow me to transfer my virtual machine to bare-metal by just simply moving
                        the disks over.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>What I'd Do Differently</h2>
                <p>While my current setup successfully meets every project objective, this build provided valuable
                    insights into how I would refine a second-generation 'ideal' architecture.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Native IPMI:</strong> Although JetKVM provided an excellent and cost-effective
                        out-of-band management solution, I would prioritize a motherboard with native IPMI in a future
                        build. Native IPMI would provide deeper hardware-level telemetry, such as fan speeds and
                        component voltages, that an external IP KVM cannot reach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dedicated Backup Server:</strong> My only real "regret" is virtualizing the Proxmox
                        Backup Server on the same host it protects. A dedicated, low power PBS host would create a
                        separate failure domain. If my Proxmox host were to fail, my backup server would still be
                        available to restore my virtual machines. This is a risk I'm willing to take for the moment to
                        get my project off the ground, and I plan to address this in the future.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Dedicated Network Gateway: </strong>JetKVM's Tailscale integration is minimal due to the
                        lightweight Busybox environment compared to a more traditional GNU Linux distribution. If I were
                        to do a "v2", I'd deploy a Raspberry Pi as a dedicated Tailnet subnet router not install
                        Tailscale on my servers directly. This simplifies management, as I don't need to have a
                        dedicated
                        jumpbox VM or install Tailscale on every appliance to access them remotely.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>Future Roadmap</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Active Directory Labs: </strong> Build a Windows environment to learn Active Directory,
                        Group Policy management, and Automation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local AI: </strong> Once high-VRAM GPUs come down in price, I'd love to deploy local,
                        private AI models. Beyond hosting standard LLMs, I plan to develop a Retrieval-Augmented
                        Generation (RAG) system. My goal is to ingest decades of archived forum data regarding the GM
                        3800 engine and Pontiac Fiero platform into a database. This will create a local AI
                        assistant capable of instant, accurate technical retrieval, eliminating the need to manually
                        sift through years of decentralized forum posts or risking cloud-hosted AI web
                        crawlers providing me false data due to a sarcastic forum post it found.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics Environment: </strong>Build isolated sandboxed
                        environments to learn about cybersecurity and DFIR concepts while I complete my university
                        coursework. I can also spin up containers and VMs to experiment with different tools within my
                        Windows labs.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Building this project was a highly rewarding experience that bridged the gap between theoretical
                    coursework and practical, enterprise-grade systems administration. By repurposing existing hardware
                    and integrating specialized solutions like JetKVM and NUT, I successfully transformed a collection
                    of components into a resilient, production-ready innovation lab. This build was an exercise in
                    strategic problem-solving: from ensuring data integrity through ZFS RAIDZ1 to achieving near 100%
                    management uptime with a secure Out-of-Band solution. Ultimately, this server provides the robust,
                    high-performance foundation I need to master complex environments as I continue my journey into IT
                    administration and cybersecurity.</p>
