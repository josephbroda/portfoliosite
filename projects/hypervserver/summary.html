                management.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This site will outline the steps I took to bring this server online; from rationale, to software
                    deployment and management.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>The catalyst for this project came to be due to the hassle of running Hyper-V on my PC. Sure,
                    performance was stellar, but having to constantly spin up my entire lab only to shut it all down
                    again later was killing my motivation. Being in a cramped dorm, I can't just leave my PC on 24/7 due
                    to the excessive heat it produces, and restarting my VMs whenever I wanted to do anything meant I
                    never got to work on long-term administration projects.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The Objective</h3>
                <p>My primary goal was simple: get these VMs off my desktop and onto an off-site, dedicated server thats
                    up 24/7. This meant building a server that was reliable, efficient, and compact enough to not get in
                    the way. Critically, I wanted to avoid investing in expensive, cutting-edge platforms, especially
                    when I already had many of the components I'd need to get this project off the ground.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The Solution</h3>
                <p>This project quickly evolved from a simple idea into a tangible solution via combination of already
                    collected hardware, serendipudious deals, and a strategic partnership with my parents to make use of
                    underutilized infrastructure.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This led to my final decision: The 16-core Ryzen 9 3950x and known-stable ASRock B550 motherboard I
                    had lying around made the perfect platform for this project. Since my goal is upmost
                    reliability, used enterprise unbuffered ECC memory in 4x16GB DIMM capacity was a solid investment
                    and even cheaper than the equivalent consumer DDR4 DIMMs at the time of purchase. Storage is handled
                    by an NVMe SSD for the OS and three 1TB NAS-optimized SATA SSDs for VM storage. For backups, I
                    deployed a separate Proxmox Backup Server on an older Dell Optiplex, utilizing my two 4TB hard
                    drives to ensure incremental backups and negate the risk of losing backups after a hypervisor
                    failure. To ensure data integrity during power events, I integrated a UPS
                    with a NUT server on the main host and a client on the backup server for synchronized graceful
                    shutdowns. Additionally, I deployed a Homebridge container with the APC UPS plugin to expose system
                    uptime and power status directly to the Apple Home app for convenient monitoring. To maintain
                    security and performance, all lab networking is isolated on its own VLAN, keeping it separate from
                    regular home network traffic. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, the greatest logistical hurdle, remote management, was solved
                    by deploying a JetKVM connected via Tailscale to ensure secure, Out-of-Band (OBB) management access
                    to the system's
                    UEFI and power controls remotely.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This whole project came in at under $1200, making it quite the capable and affordable box when
                    compared to even used enterprise gear, without sacrificing reliability and stability where it
                    counts.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned: Hyper-V Server & Workgroups</h2>
                <p>I originally provisioned this server with Hyper-V Server 2019, hoping Windows Admin Center would
                    provide sufficient web-based management as well as giving me more hands-on experience with Windows
                    administration. However, running in a workgroup environment led to
                    persistent WinRM and CredSSP authentication issues. Even after TrustedHost and Group
                    Policy workarounds, the VMConnect console
                    remained non-functional, making remote management from macOS impractical. This experience drove the
                    switch to Proxmox VE for its robust, platform-agnostic web interface.</p>

                <h2>Core Accomplishments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resilient Backup Strategy: Deploying a dedicated Proxmox Backup Server on separate hardware
                        (Dell Optiplex) to provide incremental backups and isolate failure domains.</li>
                    <li>Out-of-Band Management (OOB): Deploying and configuring a secure, hardware-level KVM over IP
                        solution via JetKVM and Tailscale for remote access and troubleshooting, ensuring 100%
                        management uptime.</li>
                    <li>Strategic Resource Optimization: Utilizing Cost-Benefit Analysis to prioritize budget towards
                        high-impact components, reusing existing capable hardware when available, and taking advantage
                        of the used market when appropriate to maximize performance per dollar.</li>
                    <li>Virtualization Platform Management: Deployment and configuration of Proxmox VE for a simplified,
                        non-domain management experience that is accessible from any device.</li>
                    <li>Automated Power Management: Configured Network UPS Tools (NUT) in a server/client architecture
                        to orchestrate graceful shutdowns across both Proxmox nodes during power outages, with real-time
                        status monitoring integrated into Apple Home via Homebridge.</li>
                    <li>Network Segmentation: Implemented VLANs to isolate lab traffic from the main home network,
                        enhancing security and preventing broadcast storms from affecting other devices.</li>
