            <h1>Remote Hyper-V Server</h1>
            <p>A low cost virtualization platform built on reliability, strategic resource optimization, and out of band management.</p>

        <section class="project-details">

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This site will outline the steps I took to bring this server online; from rationale, to software deployment and management.</p>
 <br>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>The catalyst for this project came to be due to the hassle of running Hyper-V on my PC. Sure, performance was stellar, but having to constantly spin up my entire lab only to shut it all down again later was killing my motivation. Being in a cramped dorm, I can't just leave my PC on 24/7 due to the excessive heat it produces, and restarting my VMs whenever I wanted to do anything meant I never got to work on long-term administration projects.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The Objective</h3>
                <p>My primary goal was simple: get these VMs off my desktop and onto an off-site, dedicated server thats up 24/7. This meant building a server that was reliable, efficient, and compact enough to not get in the way. Critically, I wanted to avoid investing in expensive, cutting-edge platforms, especially when I already had many of the components I'd need to get this project off the ground.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The Solution</h3>
                <p>This project quickly evolved from a simple idea into a tangible solution via combination of already collected hardware, serendipudious deals, and a strategic partnership with my parents to make use of underutilized infrastructure.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This led to my final decision: The 16-core Ryzen 9 3950x and known-stable ASRock B550 motherboard I had lying around would make the perfect platform for this project. Since my goal is upmost reliability, used enterprise unbuffered ECC memory in 4x16GB DIMM capacity was a solid investment and even cheaper than the equivalent consumer DDR4 DIMMs at the time of purchase. Storage is handled by an NVMe SSD for the OS, three 1TB NAS-optimized SATA SSDs in Storage Spaces Parity for space-efficient redundancy for my VMs, and two 4TB hard drives in Storage Spaces Mirroed for backups. Finally, the greatest logistical hurdle, remote management, was solved by deploying a JetKVM connected via Tailscale to ensure secure, Out-of-Band (OBB) management access to the system's UEFI and power controls remotely.</p>
                <br>
                 <p>This whole project came in at under $1200, making it quite the capable and affordable box when compared to even used enterprise gear, without sacrificing reliability and stability where it counts.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tiered Storage Architecture: Designing and implementing data resiliency policies using Windows Storage Spaces (Parity and Mirroring) to balance capacity, cost, and power consumption.</li>
                    <li>Out-of-Band Management (OOB): Deploying and configuring a secure, hardware-level KVM over IP solution via JetKVM and Tailscale for remote access and troubleshooting, ensuring 100% management uptime.</li>
                    <li>Strategic Resource Optimization: Utilizing Cost-Benefit Analysis to prioritize budget towards high-impact components, reusing existing & and capable hardware when available, and taking advantage of the used market when appropriate to maximise my performance per dollar.</li>
                    <li>Virtualization Platform Management: Deployment and configuration of Hyper-V Server and administrative tools (Windows Admin Center, Microsoft Management Console) for centralized management.</li>
